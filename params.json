You can find the latest updates [here](http://education.ti.com). Version 3.2 is preferred to enjoy the latest features, and 3.1 if you want to keep Ndless.\r\n\r\n## What we have done, so far :\r\nWell, \"FormulaPro\", the formulas/equation part (2nd part of EEPro). Its latest stable version is 1.3. Current dev is 1.4a.\r\nThis has been officially released (in beta) June 21st 2012 across multiple community websites :\r\nhttp://www.omnimaga.org/index.php?topic=13849 ; https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/tinspire/dlqZrAKpulM ; http://tiplanet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=126193 ; http://www.inspired-lua.org/2012/06/formulapro-v1-is-here/\r\n\r\n![Home Screen of FormulaPro](http://i.imgur.com/Uxy5N.jpg)\r\n![Reference Screen of FormulaPro](http://i.imgur.com/lcrYU.jpg)\r\n![Some solver screen](http://i.imgur.com/yUbY7.jpg)\r\n![Formulas being displayed inside solver](http://i.imgur.com/4326g.jpg)\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the document linked in the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if you don't wish to be involved in a big thing, you can help with some of the Reference parts :-)\r\n\r\nThen, the *big* part is the Analysis one, which we'll focus on later.
