![The overall organization](http://i.imgur.com/UhHn7.png)
 
The only requirement to run the .tns files is to have an Nspire OS >= 3.0. You can find the latest updates [here](http://education.ti.com).

## What we have done, so far :
Well, "FormulaPro", the formulas/equation part (2nd par of EEPro).
This has been officially released (in beta) June 21st 2012 across multiple community websites :

Please refer to the document linked in the previous paragraph.

At the same time, if you don't wish to be involved in a big thing, you can help by doing some of the Reference part :-)

Then, the *big* part is the Analysis one. (See the [EEPro Manual](http://tiplanet.org/modules/archives/eepro.pdf))
