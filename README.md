We welcome everybody, so if you want to help us, contact us by email (see down there)

![The overall organization](http://i.imgur.com/Uj6QS.png)
 
The only requirement to run the .tns files is to have an Nspire OS >= 3.0. Updates [here](http://education.ti.com).

## What do we have to do, for now ?
First, the formula/equation manager/solver part.
Please refer to the document linked in the previous paragraph.
Once that's done, we can quickly do the Reference part.
Then, the *big* part is the Analysis one. (See the [EEPro Manual](http://tiplanet.org/modules/archives/eepro.pdf))
