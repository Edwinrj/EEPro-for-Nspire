![The overall organization](http://i.imgur.com/UhHn7.png)
 
The only requirement to run the .tns files is to have an Nspire OS >= 3.0. You can find the latest updates [here](http://education.ti.com).

## What do we have to do, for now ?
First, the formula/equation manager/solver part.  (Look at this specific part on the linked document)

Please refer to the document linked in the previous paragraph.

Once that's done, we can quickly do the Reference part.

Then, the *big* part is the Analysis one. (See the [EEPro Manual](http://tiplanet.org/modules/archives/eepro.pdf))
